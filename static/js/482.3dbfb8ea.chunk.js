With her mom threading her brows for the first time in middle school, she saved her from the typical over-plucked look of that time & helped her embrace her full, defined brows from a young age (thank you, Mom!). As time passed and trends evolved, she found herself rehabilitating her friends\u2019 brows from their tweezer-addicted ways, becoming an expert in creating the perfect natural brows for any face.
