Simron is a Punjabi immigrant raised in the Bay Area. She is a natural born creative with a keen eye for aesthetics of all kinds, growing up spending her time drawing, painting, creating digital art, & experimenting with timeless makeup looks. She is inspired by old school Bollywood starlets, vintage aesthetics, and traditional black and grey tattoos. Eyebrows have always been a defining feature for women in her culture. With her mom threading her brows for the first time in middle school, she saved her from the typical over-plucked look of that time & helped her embrace her full, defined brows from a young age (thank you, Mom!). As time passed and trends evolved, she found herself rehabilitating her friends\u2019 brows from their tweezer-addicted ways, becoming an expert in creating the perfect natural brows for any face. She became certified in Cosmetic Tattooing in 2017, first specifically in Microblading, and later became certified in Nano Brows in 2020."}),(0,b.jsx)(l(),{style:{width:"100%",height:"50%"},mouseTracking:!0,infinite:!0,items:a,responsive:{0:{items:1},568:{items:2},1024:{items:3}},controlsStrategy:"alternate"})]})]})}}}]);
